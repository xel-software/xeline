          <h2>Hi, Mate!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of decentralized computation. Before you can either contribute your computational power to the network or submit some work yourself, you should backup the following mnemonic phrase; it belongs to the XEL account we have just created for you! It is essential that you back up this information and keep it in a safe place with nobody else than you having access to it. It (and only it) will allow you to recover your account at any time. By clicking <i>Get Started</i> you declare that you have backed up this phrase.</p>
